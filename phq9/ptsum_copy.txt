AS OF 2/14: wants to discuss getting insurance, finding new work

PHE Goals: Pt. says she is aware of what she should be doing for her health (exercise, blood glucose control), as well as how to do it, but she is currently not, and she does not know why. Her health goal for herself is to find a new job, which she believes will relieve a lot of the stress in her life, and help her achieve the more specific health goals of lower A1c and more exercise. She would like to speak with social work about this and about getting insurance.

Drug Genome Interactions: (01/31/12 09:00, extract for Extract)
CLOPIDOGREL interpretation: Intermediate metabolizer - Reduced anti-platelet effect - One loss-of-function (CYP2C19*4) and no gain-of-function (CYP2C19) alleles detected - Visit http://www.mydruggenome.org/clopidogrel_dgi.php for more info.
WARFARIN interpretation: Hyper responder - Starting dose adjustment may be required - Two VKORC1 (c.-1639G>A) and two CYP2C9 (*2; *3) alleles known to affect warfarin requirement detected - Visit http://www.mydruggenome.org/warfarin_dgi.php for more info.
SIMVASTATIN interpretation: Intermediate myopathy risk - One low-functioning transporter (SLCO1B1*5) allele detected. - Visit http://www.mydruggenome.org/simvastatin_dgi.php for more info.
THIOPURINES interpretation: Normal metabolizer - Normal myelotoxicity risk - No low- or non-functioning (TPMT) alleles detected - Visit http://www.mydruggenome.org/azathioprine_dgi.php for more info.
TACROLIMUS interpretation: Poor metabolizer - Standard starting dose recommended - Two non-functional (CYP3A5*3) alleles detected - Visit http://www.mydruggenome.org/tacrolimus_dgi.php for more info.
Note: Most genetic variants with therapeutic considerations demonstrate reproducibility of greater than 98%.

(3) Ms. Woodby will continue to do daily housework and errands (these are her only current means of exercise/activity). These tasks were previously not feasible due to her worsening osteoarthritis and depression.
